# NHANES Body Measurements Analysis  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing body measurements from NHANES 2020 datasets. The analysis includes weight distribution, BMI calculations, and correlations between various body measurements.

##  Files  
- NHANES_Body_Measurements_Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with analysis.  
- nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv - Dataset for adult males.

## Analysis Overview  
This project explores the NHANES 2020 dataset with the following key analyses:  
- *Histograms & Boxplots* of male and female weight distributions.  
- *BMI Calculation* using height and weight.  
- *Correlation Analysis* between weight, height, waist, hip, and BMI.  
- *Waist-to-Height & Waist-to-Hip Ratios* as alternative health indicators.  
- *Standardization & Scatterplot Matrix* to explore relationships.  
- *Extreme BMI Identification* for detecting outliers in the dataset.  

## Technologies Used  
- *Python* (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)  
- *JupyterÂ Notebook*
